# USF Summer REU in Physics: Low Loss All-Dielectric Metamaterials in the Terahertz Range
In this research project we investigated, through simulation, the effects electromagnetic waves would have on metamaterials made of
dielectric materials with high permittivity values. The polarization current, induced by the electric field or magnetic field of
the electromagnetic wave plays the same role as the electric current in metallic resonators. Due to the extremely low imaginary part of
the permittivity, our dielectric metamaterials can exhibit very low loss. We chose titanium dioxide (TiO2) to create our dielectric 
metamaterial. The THz regime of the electromagnet wave spectrum, known as the "THz gap", is a less discovered spectrum range that lays
between the radio-frequency (RF) and the infrared (IR) regimes. The THz range is important for health, security, and communications,
however, the THz range is challenging due to the lack of proper materials and sources. In this project, we used numerical simulations
to design and optimize the dielectric metamaterials exhibiting strong electric and magnetic resonances with low loss. We analyzed
the current and electromagnetic field distributions to understand the mechanism of the resonances. We studied various geometries 
including disk and cross shaped structures with the aim of seeking a proper for experimental fabrication.
